Day 3: NumPy Essentials for ML
•	Why NumPy is used in ML
•	NumPy arrays vs Python lists
•	Array creation, shape, indexing
•	Basic mathematical operations
•	Task 1: Load dataset values into NumPy arrays
•	Task 2: Perform basic operations (mean, min, max) on numerical columns
•	Task 3: Prepare feature and target arrays using NumPy

On Day 3, I explored the basics of NumPy and its role in Machine Learning.
NumPy is used in Python for fast numerical calculations and for working with multi-dimensional arrays, which are commonly used in ML.
Compared to Python lists, NumPy arrays are faster because their elements are stored in continuous memory locations, whereas list elements are stored separately and linked, making operations slower.

What I covered:

    Why NumPy is used in ML
    NumPy arrays vs Python lists
    Array creation, shape, and indexing
    Basic operations like mean, min, and max
    Loading dataset values into NumPy arrays
    Preparing feature (X) and target (y) arrays
    This helped me understand how raw data is converted into a format suitable for machine learning models.
